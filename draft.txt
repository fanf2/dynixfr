1.  Introduction

   Incremental zone transfer (IXFR, [RFC1995]) was introduced to
   efficiently transfer changed portions of a zone.  However, when a
   zone is signed with DNSSEC [RFC4033], [RFC4034], [RFC4035], the
   transfer may still become very large.  For example, when many
   resource record sets (RRsets) need a re-sign, or when the NSEC3
   [RFC5155] salt is changed, an IXFR may become larger than a full zone
   transfer (AXFR, [RFC5936]).

   To keep the deltas small in zone transfers, we need to have a richer
   update syntax, for example like in Dynamic Update (DNS UPDATE,
   [RFC2136].  This document introduces a new query type DXFR (dynamic
   zone transfer) that is able to express this richer syntax.

   An earlier proposal to keep the zone transfers small is IXFR-ONLY
   [IXFR-ONLY], by giving the client an oppurtunity to signal the server
   that it prefers an error above a fall back to an AXFR in case the
   server is not able to send an IXFR.

2.  Syntax

   The syntax for IXFR is a subset of DXFR, the richer syntax fo DXFR
   allows to add or delete multiple records with one resource record
   (RR).

2.1.  Add an RR

   This works the same as with IXFR.

2.2.  Delete an RR

   This works the same as with IXFR.

2.3.  Delete an RRset

   Similar to DNS UPDATE, one RR is added whose NAME and TYPE are those
   of the RRset to be deleted.  CLASS must be specified as ANY.
   RDLENGTH must be zero (0) and RDATA must therefore be empty.

2.4.  Delete All RRsets on a Name

   Similar to DNS UPDATE, one RR is added whose NAME is that of the name
   to be cleansed of RRsets.  TYPE must be specified as ANY.  CLASS must
   be specified as ANY.  RDLENGTH must be zero (0) and RDATA must
   therefore be empty.

2.5.  Delete All RRsets of a Type

   One RR is added whose NAME is that of the apex of the zone.  TYPE
   must be specified as the TYPE of the RRsets to be deleted.  CLASS
   must be specified as ANY.  RDLENGTH must be zero (0) and RDATA must
   therefore be empty.

2.6.  Other possibilities

   REPLACE (Johan), Grammar (Olafur), Implicitly delete RRSIG of RRset
   (Tony), Get rid of NOTIFY (Tony).

3.  Protocol Description

3.1.  Client side

   The client can send a DXFR request.  Just like with IXFR, it can add
   a SOA RR in the authority section to signal the version of the zone
   it holds now.  If the client does not want the server to fall back to
   AXFR, it can add another SOA RR in the additional section.  This
   achieves DXFR-only behavior, similar to IXFR-ONLY [IXFR-ONLY].  For
   example:

   ;; ADDITIONAL SECTION:

3.2.  Server side

   A server receiving a dynamic zone transfer (DXFR) request will reply
   with a DXFR.  A DXFR looks exactly like an IXFR, except there may be
   zero or more of the new introduced syntax RRs that can add or delete
   more records.  For "example.", the following zone transfer can be
   send that will replace all signatures in the zone with new signatures
   for the names "example.", "a.example.", "b.example." and
   "c.example.":

   ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, rcode: NOERROR, id: 1337
   ;; flags: qr ; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 9, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0
   ;; QUESTION SECTION:
   ;; example.    IN    DXFR

   ;; ANSWER SECTION:
   example.       IN    SOA    serial=3
   example.       IN    SOA    serial=1
   example.       ANY   RRSIG
   example.       IN    SOA    serial=3
   example.       IN    RRSIG  rdata
   a.example.     IN    RRSIG  rdata
   b.example.     IN    RRSIG  rdata
   c.example.     IN    RRSIG  rdata
   example.       IN    SOA    serial=3

   If the DXFR is larger than an AXFR, then the server MAY reply with an
   AXFR instead.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA should assign the RR type value [TBD] (decimal) for DXFR.
