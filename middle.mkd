# Introduction

Incremental zone transfer (IXFR, [](#RFC1995)) was introduced to efficiently
transfer changed portions of a zone. However, when a zone is signed with
DNSSEC [](#RFC4033), [](#RFC4034), [](#RFC4035), the transfer may still
become very large. For example, when many resource record sets (RRsets) need
a re-sign, or when the NSEC3 [](#RFC5155) salt is changed, an IXFR may
become larger than a full zone transfer (AXFR, [](#RFC5936)). 

To keep the deltas small in zone transfers, we need to have a richer
update syntax, for example like in Dynamic Update (DNS UPDATE, [](#RFC2136).
This document introduces a new query type DXFR (dynamic zone transfer) that
is able to express this richer syntax.

An earlier proposal to keep the zone transfers small is
IXFR-ONLY [](#IXFR-ONLY), by giving the client an oppurtunity to signal
the server that it prefers an error above a fall back to an AXFR in case the
server is not able to send an IXFR.

# Syntax

The syntax for IXFR is a subset of DXFR, the richer syntax fo DXFR allows to
add or delete multiple records with one resource record (RR).

## Add an RR

This works the same as with IXFR.

## Delete an RR

This works the same as with IXFR.

## Delete an RRset

Similar to DNS UPDATE, one RR is added whose NAME and TYPE are those
of the RRset to be deleted. CLASS must be specified as ANY.
RDLENGTH must be zero (0) and RDATA must therefore be empty.

## Delete All RRsets on a Name

Similar to DNS UPDATE, one RR is added whose NAME is that of the name
to be cleansed of RRsets. TYPE must be specified as ANY. CLASS must be
specified as ANY.  RDLENGTH must be zero (0) and RDATA must therefore be
empty.

## Delete All RRsets of a Type

One RR is added whose NAME is that of the apex of the zone. TYPE must be
specified as the TYPE of the RRsets to be deleted. CLASS must be specified as
ANY. RDLENGTH must be zero (0) and RDATA must therefore be empty.

# Protocol Description

## Client side

The client can send a DXFR request. Just like with IXFR, it can add a SOA
RR in the authority section to signal the version of the zone it holds now.
If the client does not want the server to fall back to AXFR, it can add
another SOA RR in the additional section. This achieves DXFR-only behavior, 
similar to IXFR-ONLY [](#IXFR-ONLY). For example:

    ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, rcode: NOERROR, id: 1337
    ;; flags: qr ; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 1, ADDITIONAL: 1
    ;; QUESTION SECTION:
    ;; example.    IN    DXFR
    
    ;; AUTHORITY SECTION:
    example.       IN    SOA    serial=1
    
    ;; ADDITIONAL SECTION:
    example.       IN    SOA    serial=1

## Server side

A server receiving a dynamic zone transfer (DXFR) request will reply with
a DXFR. A DXFR looks exactly like an IXFR, except there may be zero or more
of the new introduced syntax RRs that can add or delete more records.
For `example.`, the following zone transfer can be send that will
replace all signatures in the zone with new signatures for the names
`example.`, `a.example.`, `b.example.` and `c.example.`:

    ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, rcode: NOERROR, id: 1337
    ;; flags: qr ; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 9, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0 
    ;; QUESTION SECTION:
    ;; example.    IN    DXFR
    
    ;; ANSWER SECTION:
    example.       IN    SOA    serial=3
    example.       IN    SOA    serial=1
    example.       ANY   RRSIG
    example.       IN    SOA    serial=3
    example.       IN    RRSIG  rdata
    a.example.     IN    RRSIG  rdata
    b.example.     IN    RRSIG  rdata
    c.example.     IN    RRSIG  rdata
    example.       IN    SOA    serial=3
    
If the DXFR is larger than an AXFR, then the server MAY reply with an AXFR
instead.

# IANA Considerations

IANA should assign the RR type value [TBD] (decimal) for DXFR.

This document does not introduce additional security considerations.
